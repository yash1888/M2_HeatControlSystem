Industrial process heat is defined as thermal energy used directly in the preparation or treatment of materials used to produce manufactured goods. In developing countries, the industrial sector is responsible for 30 to 65 percent of total national energy consumption. Commercially available solar systems have the potential to provide a large fraction of the energy consumed by industry. Industrial process heat needs can be categorized as follows: preheat for boiler feedwater, hot water for various processes, hot air for drying, steam production, and direct heating. It is possible to design solar energy systems capable of providing heat energy for each of these needs. However, near-term solar process heat technologies will probably be utilized to meet the major heating needs, classified by output: hot water (feedwater preheat or process water), hot air, and low pressure steam.
